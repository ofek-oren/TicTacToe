# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game created to improve my React skills. The project is inspired by the [React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#setup-for-the-tutorial), but it is not a step-by-step copy. 

## Getting Started

To duplicate this project on your computer, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

### Installation

1. **Create a new React app**:

    Follow the instructions on the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) website to set up a new React project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npx create-react-app my-tictactoe-app
    ```

2. **Swap the `App.js` and `App.css` files**:

    Replace the `App.js` and `App.css` files in your newly created React project with the ones provided in this repository. You can do this by copying and pasting the files from this repository into the `src` folder of your new React app.

3. **Run the app**:

    Navigate to your project directory and start the development server by running:

    ```bash
    cd my-tictactoe-app
    npm start
    ```

    This will open your new Tic-Tac-Toe game in your default web browser.

### Usage

Once the development server is running, you can open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to play the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Project Structure

- `App.js`: The main component that renders the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- `App.css`: The styles for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
